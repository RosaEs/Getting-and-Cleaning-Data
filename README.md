Getting-and-Cleaning-Data Project
=================================

The data represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:

http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

Here are the data for the project:

The UCI HAR Dataset folder has the files required structure.
 
Change working directory as  ...\UCI HAR Dataset
Run the script called run_analysis.R that does the following. 

Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names. 
Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. 

The tidy data set that merges the training and the test sets should be created as "first_tidy_data_set.txt"
The second tidy dataset with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject should be created in       the current directory as "second_tidy_data_set.txt"

The file CodeBook.md describes the variables, the data, and the transformations performed to clean up the data.
